# To-Do Web App

A **To-Do Web App** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**. This project helped me understand **localStorage**, ensuring that data persists even after reloading the page. I also focused on making the app **fully responsive** and added a **favicon** for a polished user experience.

## Features
- **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks**
- **Persistent Data Storage** using **localStorage** (tasks remain after page reload)
- **Responsive Design** for mobile and desktop users
- **Favicon for better UI branding**
- **User-friendly Interface** with smooth animations

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the app
- **CSS**: For styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript**: For functionality and local storage integration
